0,Amin kharkongor ,Shillong,1,"Sep, 2017",Good but one foot is smaller. The sole is hard compared to other adidas that I have bought . But funny thing is that it's serial number is not available in adidas global database. This is the first product that am not much satisfied with flipkart.After my routine of 10k and 7.5k road running which I went through a terrible discomfort experience of which now atleast I can say that either adidas has lost its touch in quality product or its a copy .

The sole is so hard that it makes your foot pain and sore. Big mistake that dint go by the reviews. Pls do not buy. There is no model as such produced by adidas.
